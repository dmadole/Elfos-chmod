Name:
  chmod - change flags on files

Usage:
  chmod [-v] [-d] [+[x|w|h|a]|-[x|w|h|a]] ... path

Description:
  This command changes flag bits on files as specified. This command can 
  operate on either a single file, or all files within a directory.

Options:
  -v (verbose) displays the paths of all files that are modified
  -d (directory) operates on all the files within a directory
  -x/+x (executable) clears/sets bit 02h marking the file executable
  -w/+w (write protect) clears/sets bit 04h marking the file write protected
  -h/+h (hidden) clears/sets bit 08h marking the file as hidden
  -a/+a (archive) clears/sets bit 10h marking the file as archive-ready

Details:
  At this time, flags can only be changed on files and not directories. When 
  the option -d is used, directories encountered will not be modified.
  
  When the path name is specified with a trailing slash, it is treated the 
  same as if the -d option was specified.

  Options of like types can be concatenated after a single leading (+ or -), 
  and options may be specified multiple times. The last definition of each 
  flag bit, ordered left-to-right, is what is applied to the file.
